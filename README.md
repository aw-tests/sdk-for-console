## Installation

### NPM

To install via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install appwrite --save
```

If you're using a bundler (like [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) or [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)), you can import the  module when you need it:

```js
import * as Appwrite from "appwrite";
```

### CDN

To install with a CDN (content delivery network) add the following scripts to the bottom of your <body> tag, but before you use any  services:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/appwrite@1.0.28"></script>
```
